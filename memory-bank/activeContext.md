# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Initialization Phase**
We are currently setting up the project structure and "Memory Bank" to ensure a solid foundation for development.

## Recent Changes
*   [x] Analyzed existing documentation (`documentation/` folder).
*   [x] Created `implementation_plan.md` for Memory Bank setup.
*   [x] Established `memory-bank/` directory structure.

## Next Steps
1.  Create `activeContext.md` (This file).
2.  Initialize the actual Tauri v2 project structure (`npm create tauri-app`).
3.  Set up the Git repository.
4.  Begin "Phase 1" of development: Dependencies and Sidecar setup.
